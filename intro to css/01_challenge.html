  <p><strong>Cockatoos</strong> are recognisable by the prominent <em>crests and curved bills</em>. Their plumage is generally less colourful than that of other <strike>parrots</strike>, being mainly white, grey or black and often with coloured features in the crest, cheeks or tail. <br><strong>Cockatoos</strong> prefer to eat <em>seeds, tubers, corms, fruit, flowers and insects</em>. They often feed in large flocks, particularly when ground-feeding. <br><strong>Cockatoos</strong> are popular birds in aviculture, but their needs are difficult to meet. The cockatiel is the easiest cockatoo species to maintain and is by far the most frequently kept in captivity. White cockatoos are more commonly found in captivity than black cockatoos. <strong><em>Illegal trade in wild-caught birds contributes to the decline of some cockatoo species in the wild.</em></strong></p>
